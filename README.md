# ConsumerReview Lab with Objects
This is an Object-Based version of the ConsumerReview lab from the College Board.\
It takes the black-box-ness out of the College Board version, by using an ArrayList instead of a HashMap, by searching using a binary search rather than the contains() method, and by including all code inside methods. It is also based on individual Objects like SentimentList and Review to better compartmentalize the code.\
\
This is semi-completed code, through Activity Four on my list of activities, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16WpkOqSf3-6WR9vLl8oqlHNyLfSD2UaoFm2Jr_bm4BI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>
